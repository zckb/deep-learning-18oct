Artificial intelligence and machine learning systems have existed since the 1950s. Rapid technological advances and breakthroughs achieved in the last decade, has begun to show the true potential and impact of these systems. Today, Deep Learning (a subset of machine learning) is transforming every industry and helping to solve problems that seemed impossible only a few years ago. What is deep learning and who is using it? Why is adoption happening so quickly, and how can deep learning help in your next project? Join our Deep Learning workshop to learn more.
 
Workshop: This one-day technical workshop is designed to give you a deeper understanding of Deep Learning and the cloud infrastructures available to accelerate discovery in any scientific discipline. Learn more about how to get started and what it takes to develop successful Deep Learning projects. You will leave the workshop with a knowledge of various use cases and examine example scenarios.
